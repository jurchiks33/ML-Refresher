* NumPy provides the ndarray: a fixed-type, memory-efficient, fast N-dimensional array.

- ML is mostly linear algebra + Statistics => NumPy is optimized for these operations.
- Vectorized operations are mutch faster than Python Loops
- Understanding shapes ((n_samples, n_features)) is essential for model input/output.
